                                        SMEK Fitness Group is an athletic facility designed for people who 
                                        want more than the sweaty, cramped, and outdated gym experience. 
                                        The facility includes a traditional gym with free weights, cables, 
                                        treadmills and other machines, and a small turf area. Additionally, 
                                        members have access to a 6-lane pool, a spinning room, a boxing area, 
                                        and a yoga studio. Each of these additional spaces plays host to a 
                                        class lead by one of our specialized staff members in their area of 
                                        expertise.

                                        SMEK Fitness was founded by four hard-working students at Tufts
                                        University in early 2023. They were tired of the cramped on-campus
                                        weight room and wanted to create a space for themselves and others 
                                        to enjoy. They decided on a name that represented both themselves, 
                                        using the first letter from each of their names, and four principles 
                                        which they hoped to cultivate in their new space.
